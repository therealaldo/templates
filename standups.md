# Daily Stand-Ups Template

Below is the template for how to conduct daily stand ups between all teams within the company.

## Format

We want to keep these short and sweet, so we are really going to just answer these 3 questions:

* **What did you work on yesterday?**
* **What will you work on today?**
* **What issues did you experience yesterday, and are they any issues blocking you from moving forward today?**

---

### *What did you work on yesterday?*

Let us know what specific goals you accomplished yesterday, i.e. goals, cards, issues, etc.

> "I worked on the presentation for the meeting."

> "I worked on the player slider in a live session."

---

### *What will you work on today?*

Let us know what goals/cards/issues you would like to accomplish by day's end.

> "I'm going to put together the roles and responsibilities for new hires."

> "I will continue to work on the player slider because I am still not done with it."

---

### *What issues did you experience yesterday, and are there any issues blocking you from moving forward today?*

Let us know what issues, if any, you experienced yesterday, as well as any issues you currently have that aren't allowing you to accomplish your goals for the day.

> "There were no issues yesterday, and there are currently no issues blocking me."

> "One issue I experienced yesterday was the player slider time being reset when you would pause the currently playing track. I've come up with a solution since then with seemingly no issues blocking me for today."
