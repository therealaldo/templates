### Creating a card

#### Title *(Required)*

Give a title that gives a general idea as to what the card pertains to, i.e. a new feature, a problem, a presentation, etc.

> Outreach
>
> Live Session Track Slider
>
> Shirt Designs
>
> Shut Down Rancher Process
>
> Equity Incentive Plan

#### Description *(Required)*

Provide a detailed description with the necessary information needed to work on the card. The more descriptive you are here, the better! The scrum value should be the first thing as well in the format of `(MM/DD/YY) Scrum Value = value` if the card is a task. If the card is an epic or story, the scrum value is not necessary Apply the value based on the Fibonacci sequence, comparing the card to other cards to know where you should classify the task. If the value has to be updated, don't delete the old ones listed, and instead, write the new value above the older ones, crossing out the older assessments.

> (12/21/18) **Scrum Value = 13**
> Designing and filing for a trademark that will establish 'marks' to distinguish our brand.
>
> (3/27/19) **Scrum Value = 5**
> ~~(3/25/19) **Scrum Value = 8**~~
> Implement a nested FlatList in the footer component for the live session's VirtualizedList containing the first 3 tracks in the more to play of the session.
>
> (4/6/19) **Scrum Value = 5**
> Looking to make standing connections to sell merchandise.
>

> Add the functionality to save music to the current user's Spotify library.

### Moving a card

### Editing a card

When editing a card, be sure to not make any unnecessary edits to the card. The most common edit that will be made to cards will be in the way of adding comments. These comments can include anything from a normal conversation relating to the card to any issues the members are currently experiencing on the card itself. If that's the case, please provide any additional information, whether it be screenshots, files, etc.

---

### Archiving a card

The time to archive cards are when we've recorded what was completed and what wasn't completed at the Trello grooming. This allows for all cards that are currently on the boards outside of *Backlog* to be associated with the current sprint. Make sure not to actually delete the card and to only archive it.

---

### Improvements

If you see an area that can be improved upon, contact the team members in the specific board and suggest what you think could be improved. If you want to suggest an improvement to the template, contact any of the team leads to talk through the proposed changes.
