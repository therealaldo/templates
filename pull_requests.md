# Pull Requests Template

Below is the template for how to open and submit PRs to Ultrasound. Small pull requests are much easier to review and more likely to get merged. Make sure the PR does only one thing, otherwise please split it.

Please make sure the following is completed when submitting a pull request:

1. Fork the repository and create your branch from `master`.
1. Describe your test plan in your pull request description. Make sure to test your changes!
1. If you haven't already, sign the CLA before submitting your pull request.

## Format

Our goal is to have descriptive, relevant information that pertains to the pull request attached, whether that be by adding screenshots where appropriate or even having additional information based on the type of change it may be. The format for PRs is as follows:

* **Description**
* **Motivation &amp; Context**
* **How Has This Been Tested?**
* **Screenshots (if appropriate)**
* **Types of Changes**
* **Checklist**

### Description

Provide a description summarizing what your pull request is for.

> Adding the ability to transform text within the app. My test plan involves having added a test-case to the RNTester app within the `<Text>` component area. I then manually verified that the rendered content met my expectation.

#### Test Plan

A good test plan has the exact commands you ran and their output. Also provide screenshots or videos if your pull request changes the UI.

* If you've added code that should be tested, add tests!
* If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.

See [What is a Test Plan?](https://medium.com/@martinkonicek/what-is-a-test-plan-8bfc840ec171#.y9lcuqqi9) to learn more.

### Motivation and Context

Let us know what your motivation and context are for opening your pull request.

> The basic desire is to have a declarative mechanism to transform text context to uppercase or lowercase or titlecase ("capitalized").

### How Has This Been Tested

Let us know how your pull request has been tested. If tests need to be written for your pull request, a great suggestion would be to write your tests yourself for a better chance of the request being accepted.

>     This TEXT SHOULD be lowercased.
>   </Text>
>   <Text style={{ textTransform: 'capitalize'}}>
