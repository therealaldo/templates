# Bi-Weekly Sprint Grooming Template

Below is the template for how to structure the bi-weekly agile posts covering the work you selected from the previous sprint as well as the upcoming sprint. Sprints are 2 weeks, starting on Monday, and ending on the Saturday of the second week at midnight.

## Format

The point of these is to be able to glance quickly and know what has been completed, what hasn't been completed, and how much work tasks are worth.

* **Previous Sprint**
* **Current Sprint**

---

### Previous Sprint

Regarding the work from the previous sprint, we'll be breaking the tasks into 2 categories of *Completed* and *Unfinished* with the total scrum value of the corresponding tasks next to the title.

> ### Previous Sprint (1/1 - 1/13)
>
> **Completed** - 20
>
> * 5 - task name
> * 5 - task name
> * 5 - task name
> * 5 - task name
>
> **Unfinished** - 10
>
> * 5 - task name
> * 5 - task name

### Current Sprint

For the current sprint, the format is very similar to above, except instead of the 2 sections, we'll break the tasks up by what board they are on. The total scrum value for the tasks under each board should be next to the title with a link back to each of the task cards on Trello. When the cards have been completed fully, check the item in the list.

> ### Current Sprint (1/15 - 1/27)
>
> **App Development** - 5
>
> * [ ] 5 - [task name](https://github.com/therealaldo/templates/blob/master/agile.md)

> **Dev Workboard** - 25
